**# Rule #1: DGD - Don't Go Discounting.**

  
If you aren't a discounter, don't become one in a recession. Once you go promotional, there is no turning back, you are a promotional brand. That's why rule number one of resilient merchandising is DGD—_*don't go discounting*_. 

In a March 2020 article, McKinsey gets this core point right (even if they suffer from a combination of halo effect and survivors bias in claiming that resilient retailers "anticipated a recession"), once you adopt discounting as your tool of choice customers expect low margins and discounts.

The retailers that went promotional during the 2008-2009 recession didn't have a brand to return to when customers were ready to spend money. "_*Don't go discounting*_ is the simplest insight to follow and at the same time one of the hardest. It will no doubt claim many e-commerce and retail casualties in the next few years. 

__**Power Growth Recommendation:**__ Watch your competitors exhaust their cash reserves through heavy discounting. Instead of joining their game, orient your value proposition towards value and ensure you have quality lower priced point selections in each of your key categories. Merchandise a few of your most desirable and aspirational product lines (see Tiffany's engagement ring example below) along side quality lower price point options to serve as a reminder that you offer customers quality—not discounted goods.

> __**Reshape the value proposition.**__ Reading the trends and repositioning assortment, pricing, and merchandising helped resilient retailers safeguard their existing sales and find new customers. Many nonresilient retailers offered broad discounts to retain customers and boost sales during the recession, which had the side effect of reducing margins in a manner that can be difficult to restore when conditions improve. Resilient retailers were more adept at careful segmentation. T&CO (Tiffany’s), for example, dropped the average price of its high-end fashion jewelry by 25 percent in 2008–09 but increased the prices of its recession-proof engagement jewelry by 10 percent. The result: its net revenues rose, and its margins were stable.
